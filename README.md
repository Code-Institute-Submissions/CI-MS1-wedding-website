<h1 align="center">Wedding Website</h1> 

Milestone 1 project - Full Stack Web Developer course - Code Institute 

This website will work as the invitation and information page for a wedding. The point of having a website instead of a classic letter invitation is for the guests (users) to have easy access to all info they need and to be able to RSVP directly via a form. It is also a much better way for the website owner (couple getting married) to have an easy way of keeping track on RSVP's as well as other requests.
 
## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### User Stories

See below user stories:

> *- "As an invited guest, I expect to find all the practical information I need, so I can prepare for the wedding"*

> *- "As an invited guest, I expect that I will be able to smoothly RSVP to the invitation, so that I do not have to contact the couple directly for that purpose"*

### Strategy

The main goal for this website is to act as an invitation and information hub for the guests of the wedding, where they can see all details as well as RSVP directly in an effortless manner. This will be displayed in a user friendly, minimal and beautifully designed way. The website will also act as a platform for the couple where they will be able to see how many guests are coming as well as other requests.

Project goals: 

- Design a beautiful welcoming website fitting for a wedding
- Have all relevant information available in a user friendly environment for the users
- Have a RSVP page which is simple to navigate for any user

### Scope

The features of this website will let the users:

- Find all the details they need for the wedding
- RSVP directly via the website through a form with options to add additional important info 
- Get access to specific contact information for questions about the wedding

**Colors**

I have decided to go with the color palette below. This matches the elegance of the wedding theme, as well as the cherry blossom and Japan inspiration the website has.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - RSVP - allows guests to inform if they are coming to the wedding, by filling out a form

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

**Languages**

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
    - Main programming language

- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
    - Main programming language

**Frameworks**

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - Connected to HTML via CDN. Main framework for the website in order to improve the structure of the website


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
